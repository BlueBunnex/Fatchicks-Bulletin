        <p><strong>I am vehemently against child sexual abuse. This page serves to point out 1) that pedophiles are not the same as child molesters 2) demonizing pedophiles only hinders them from reaching out for help.</strong></p>

    <div class="center">

        <p>...involves deconstructing some common misconceptions about pedophilia and child sexual abuse, and shed light on the actual facts that point towards treating pedophilia much differently than we currently do:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Being a pedophile does not mean someone has sexually abused children.</li>
            <li>Someone who sexually abuses children is not necessarily a pedophile.</li>
            <li>Many pedophiles do want to seek help and change, but are too scared to face backlash for admitting they're attracted to children.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What does "MAP" mean? Why is it so stigmatized?</h2>
        
        <p>the term MAP is used in the sciences. also, people who are attracted to minors OUGHT TO self-identify as MAPs in order to then reach out for help about it (such as in mentioned support forums)</p>
    
        <p>Compare a non-child molester pedophile to someone with a strong attraction to breasts. While that person may fantasize about groping a stranger's breasts, they would feel disgust at the idea of acting out that fantasy. Just like a pedophile, this person understands that society condemns acting on their sexual desires.</p>
        
        <p>People stigmatize the term "MAP" because they believe its introduction attempts to normalize child sexual abuse.</p>
    
        <p>It is a crime to molest children. It is not a crime to be attracted to them; but it can become a crime if the individual does not reach out for therapy. So why don't they? Well, MAPs are demonized in our society despite often having never committed a crime. Revealing youself as one is social suicide.</p>

        <h2>Pedophilia is an attraction, not an action</h2>
        
        <p>Pedophilia is not synonymous with "person who commits child sexual abuse"</p>
        
        <p>this will be a venn diagram</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pedophile / attracted to children from birth, but has not sexually abused children despite feeling the urge to do so</li>
            <li>child molester / not attracted to children, has sexually abused children to feel power/exert control</li>
            <li>pedophile AND child molester / attracted to children from birth, has sexually abused children either for sexual gratification, to feel power/exert control, or both</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pedophilia is a psychological disorder that requires treatment</h2>
        <p>
            Pedophilia is a form of paraphilia. Because it causes harm to others, it is considered a disorder.
            Doctors diagnose pedophilia when people feel greatly distressed or become less able to function well because of their attraction to children or when they have acted on their urges.
            This is to say, a person attracted to minors that has no trouble resisting their desires is not considered as having Pedophilic Disorder.
        </p>
        <p>Pedophilia, especially in predatory pedophiles, often cooccurs with other disorders like antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorder, depression, and so forth, emphasizing the need for therapy and treatment.</p>
        <p>Demonizing pedophiles online is not treatment in the same way that telling an autistic person they're "faking it for attention" is not a treatment.</p>

        <p>similar demonization of psychological disorders occurrs/occurred for narcissistic personality disorder, schizophrenia, dissociative identity disorder (formerly multiple personality disorder; think of all the thriller films about the person with an evil second self!).</p>
