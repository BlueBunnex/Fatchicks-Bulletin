    <p><strong>I am vehemently against child sexual abuse. This page serves to point out that pedophiles 1) are not the same as child molesters 2) should not be demonized in society lest they fear reaching out for help.</strong></p>

    <p>This page is still under heavy development.</p>
    
    <h1>Understanding MAPs</h1>
    
    <h2>What does "MAP" mean? Why is it so stigmatized?</h2>
    
    <p>[<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-021-02160-z">src</a>] the term MAP is used in the sciences. also, people who are attracted to minors OUGHT TO self-identify as MAPs in order to then reach out for help about it (such as in mentioned support forums)</p>

    <p>People stigmatize the term "MAP" because they believe its introduction attempts to normalize child sexual abuse.</p>
    
    <p>Compare a non-child molester pedophile to someone with a strong attraction to breasts. While that person may fantasize about groping a stranger's breasts, they would feel disgust at the idea of acting out that fantasy. Just like a pedophile, this person understands that society condemns acting on their sexual desires.</p>
    
    <h2>Pedophilia is an attraction, not an act</h2>
    
    <p>[<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2022/01/10/pedophiles-pedophilia-sexual-disorder/8768423002/">src</a>] Pedophilia is not synonymous with "person who commits child sexual abuse"</p>
    
    <p>this will be a venn diagram</p>
    <ul>
        <li>pedophile / attracted to children from birth, but has not sexually abused children despite feeling the urge to do so</li>
        <li>child molester / not attracted to children, has sexually abused children to feel power/exert control</li>
        <li>pedophile AND child molester / attracted to children from birth, has sexually abused children either for sexual gratification, to feel power/exert control, or both</li>
    </ul>
