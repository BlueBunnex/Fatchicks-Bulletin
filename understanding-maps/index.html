            <h4 style="color: #262;">Introduction</h4>
            <p>The term pedophile is often misused in common media to refer to someone who sexually abuses children, but this oversimplification mischaracterizes many people who, while attracted to children, have never acted or even vehemently disapprove of their attraction. Among other things, I want to discuss a number of things people get wrong about pedophilia:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Being a pedophile does not mean someone has sexually abused children.</li>
                <li>Someone who sexually abuses children is not necessarily a pedophile.</li>
                <li>Pedophilia is a treatable mental disorder.</li>
                <li>Many pedophiles don't want to sexually abuse children, want to get help, but are too scared to do so for fear of backlash from admitting they're attracted to children.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>In honest, pedophilia is a taboo subject, which is part of the reason why people object so vehemently any discussion of pedophilia as something other than an immoral crime. However, [this exact treatment of pedophilia only encourages it]. Please recognize that I do not discuss this topic with aims of normalizing child sexual abuse; rather, to encourage change that could lead to decreased rates of child sexual abuse.</p>
            
            <p>I hope through this paper I can enrich your understanding of pedophilia, child sexual abuse, and society's view of certain mental disorders, deconstructing some common misconceptions about pedophilia and child sexual abuse, and shed light on the actual facts that point towards treating pedophilia much differently than we currently do.</p>

        <h2>Disgust</h2>

        <p>talk about philosophy of disgust influencing decision-making, and how we ought to shed disgust in order to see how to actually reach a solution</p>
        
        
        <h2>What is pedophilia, and what is not</h2> <!-- pedophiles are not the same as child molesters -->

        <p>Pedophilia is a psychological disorder that people have from birth [environmental? get research] [we need to establish that pedophilia itself is not a choice, only the choice of acting on it]</p>
        
        <p>Pedophilia is not synonymous with "person who commits child sexual abuse."</p>
        
        <p>this will be a venn diagram</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pedophile / attracted to children from birth, but has not sexually abused children despite feeling the urge to do so</li>
            <li>child molester / not attracted to children, has sexually abused children to feel power/exert control</li>
            <li>pedophile AND child molester / attracted to children from birth, has sexually abused children either for sexual gratification, to feel power/exert control, or both</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Compare a non-child molester pedophile to someone with a strong attraction to breasts. While that person may fantasize about groping a stranger's breasts, they would feel disgust at the idea of acting out that fantasy. Just like a pedophile, this person understands that society condemns acting on such sexual desires. As one article puts it, "pedophilia is an attraction, not an action."</p>

        <!-- transition -->
        <p>Whether a pedophile becomes a child molester depends on their ability to keep themself from acting on their desires, even when given an opportunity to do so. In truth, it is hard to condemn a pedophile who is able to absolutely resist their desires. If our goal is to lower rates of child sexual abuse...... then we can either imprison all child molesters forever (not simply pedophiles - just being attracted to children isn't a crime), or we can give them therapy</p>

        <h2>Pedophilia treatment: Prison or therapy?</h2>
        
        <p>Argue that evidence shows post-incarceration re-offending is lower when therapy happens [read full article, A 2004 study, which included 109 convicted sex offenders who completed therapy and 37 who dropped out, showed "non-completers" were six times as likely to commit another sexual or violent crime, compared with those who completed therapy.]</p>
        <p>As a psychological disorder, pedophilia that requires treatment.</p>
        <p>
            Pedophilia is a form of paraphilia. Because it causes harm to others, it is considered a disorder.
            Doctors diagnose pedophilia when people feel greatly distressed or become less able to function well because of their attraction to children or when they have acted on their urges.
            This is to say, a person attracted to minors that has no trouble resisting their desires is not considered as having Pedophilic Disorder.
        </p>
        <p>Pedophilia, especially in predatory pedophiles, often cooccurs with other disorders like antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorder, depression, and so forth, emphasizing the need for therapy and treatment.</p>
        <p>Demonizing pedophiles online is not treatment in the same way that telling an autistic person they're "faking it for attention" is not a treatment.</p>
        <p>Treatment is most effective when participation is voluntary (aka at the very least don't demonize people who really want to get treatment but are scared to).</p>

        </cite>

        <p>similar demonization of psychological disorders occurs/occurred for narcissistic personality disorder, schizophrenia, dissociative identity disorder (formerly multiple personality disorder; think of all the thriller films about the person with an evil second self!), etc. What's the difference between these disorders and other disorders that aren't demonized, like autism and ADHD? There is a double standard that negatively affects people with disorders that predispose them to illegal or immoral activity (violence, rape).</p>

        <!-- transition -->
        <p>If treatment can keep pedophiles from becoming child molesters, and pedophiles exist that don't want to molest children (but nevertheless feel the urge to do so), why don't they seek treatment? Understand that, pedophiles are demonized in our society despite often having never acted immorally or committed a crime. Revealing youself as one is social suicide.</p>


        <h2>Pedophilia stigma prevents treatment</h2> <!-- demonizing pedophiles only hinders them from reaching out for help -->

        <p>People stigmatize the term "MAP" because they believe its introduction attempts to normalize child sexual abuse.</p>
        
        <p>the term MAP is used in the sciences. also, people who are attracted to minors OUGHT TO self-identify as MAPs in order to then reach out for help about it (such as in mentioned support forums)</p>
