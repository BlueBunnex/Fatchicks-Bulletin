                <h1>An analysis of meme characters</h1>
                <p><i>Popular memes change in response to the goals of the people creating them. While both <strong>rage faces</strong> and modern <strong>wojaks</strong> appear in comic formats and share a similar artstyle, I wanna talk about what sets them apart.</i></p>
                <img src="https://preview.redd.it/m6bvw5qau6c51.jpg?auto=webp&s=999b4843afa26460b53ff3557876d420a9825b78">
            
                <h2>Rage faces are stage masks</h2>
                <p>A lot of (but certainly not all) rage faces parallel character archetypes in media. The most obvious are troll faces that are unanimously depicted as disruptive and humourous, filling in the role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickster">trickster</a> character.</p>
                
                <h2>Meme characters are more diverse than ever</h2>
                <p>Rage faces give emotion to a character, but aside from this have little visually to convey demographic. They are 'blank slates' that setting and dialogue turn into more specific characters.</p>
                <p>There are of course exceptions, the most notable being a female variation (often named <i>Derpina</i>) represented by adding blonde hair. In some cases people would include even more visual demographic information (such as changing skin color), but these were rare and do not represent the majority of comics.</p>
                <p>Contrast this with wojaks that are filled with culture, many representing various (perhaps overly genericized) demographics. Hispanic, black, and asian wojaks, while still not incredibly common, appear more frequently than for rage faces to represent characters of various races. Then there are 'chads,' 'soyboys,' 'chuds,' and so forth that represent characters of various lifestyles and worldviews. This leads to the interesting observation that, while rage faces often represent character archetypes, wojaks often represent demographic stereotypes.</p>
