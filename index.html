                <h1>An analysis of meme characters</h1>
                <p><i>Popular memes change in response to the goals of the people creating them. While both <strong>rage faces</strong> and modern <strong>wojaks</strong> appear in comic formats and share a similar artstyle, I wanna talk about what sets them apart.</i></p>
                <img style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid grey;" src="https://preview.redd.it/m6bvw5qau6c51.jpg?auto=webp&s=999b4843afa26460b53ff3557876d420a9825b78">
            
                <h2>Meme characters are stage masks</h2>
                <p>Meme characters, like early acting, are very exaggerated in how they convey emotion...</p>
                <p>I find it interesting to note a parallel between one rage face in particular and the concept of character archetypes in media. <strong>Troll faces</strong> unanimously depict characters that are disruptive and conniving, filling in the role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickster">trickster</a> character. This is different from other rage faces that only convey an emotion, rather than a set personality or character.</p>
                
                <h2>Meme characters are more diverse than ever</h2>
                <p>Rage faces give emotion to a character, but aside from this have little visually to convey demographic. They are 'blank slates' that setting and dialogue turn into more specific characters.</p>
                <p>There are of course exceptions, the most notable being a female variation (often named <i>Derpina</i> or <i>Derpette</i>) represented by adding feminine hair. In some cases people would include even more visual demographic information (such as changing skin color), but these were rare and do not represent the majority of comics.</p>
                <p>Contrast this with wojaks that are filled with culture, many representing various (perhaps overly genericized) demographics. Hispanic, black, and asian wojaks, while still not incredibly common, appear more frequently than for rage faces to represent characters of various races. Then there are 'chads,' 'soyboys,' 'doomers,' and so forth that represent characters of various lifestyles and worldviews. This leads to the interesting observation that, while rage faces often represent character archetypes, wojaks often represent demographic stereotypes.</p>
