    <h1></h1>
    <p>I think it's pretty cool to compare the differences between <strong>rage faces</strong> and modern <strong>wojaks</strong>. Just like the transition</p>

    <h2>Troll faces are the trickster archetype</h2>
    <p>A lot of (but certainly not all) rage faces represent character archetypes in media. The most obvious are troll faces that are unanimously depicted as disruptive and humourous, filling in the role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickster">trickster</a> character.</p>
    
    <h2>Meme characters are more diverse than ever</h2>
    <p>Rage faces give emotion to a character, but aside from this have little visually to convey demographic. They are 'blank slates' that setting and dialogue turn into more specific characters.</p>
    <p>There are of course exceptions, the most notable being a female variation (often named <strong>Derpina</strong>) represented by adding blonde hair. In some cases people would include even more visual demographic information (such as changing skin color), but these were rare and do not represent the majority of comics.</p>
    <p>Contrast this with wojaks that are filled with culture, many representing various (perhaps overly genericized) demographics. In common use are hispanic, black, white, and asian wojaks that are used to represent characters of various races. Then there are 'chads,' 'soyboys,' 'chuds,' and 'incels' that represent characters of various lifestyles and worldviews. This leads to the interesting observation that, while rage faces often represent character archetypes, wojaks often represent demographic stereotypes.</p>
