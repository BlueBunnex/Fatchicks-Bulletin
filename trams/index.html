    <p>The major difference between trains and trams is that <strong>trains travel long distances at high speeds</strong> (such as between cities or even countries), whereas <strong>trams travel shorter distances at lower speeds</strong> (such as within a city). As a result, trams stop more frequently and their stops are closer together. Trams only carry passengers, while trains often carry cargo as well passengers.</p>
