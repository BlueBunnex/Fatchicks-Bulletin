### Todo

- Phase out Cloudant (doesn't support deletion) for a more appropriate database format (rolling)
  - Maybe a file one: then we can store posts as `<ID>.txt` and their corresponding image as `<ID>.png`
  - But for now we sleep :zzz:
- Implement image attachment
- Implement comments (NOT a type of post)
