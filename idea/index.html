    <h1>Swordplay</h1>
    
    <p>what if I learned sword crafting and made my own sword and practiced slashing and cutting suspended pieces of paper and got pretty good at it and felt accomplished both physically and mentally by having the discipline to take on a physical hobby</p>

        <li>Do not force the hand of others.</li>

    <p>Life is not better than the spiritual realm. Spirits go into our world and become people only to return here with eternal, peaceful nothingness. Within this world, one can do a lot to grow as a being, experience hardships and greatness, but it is not the ultimate place. https://www.reddit.com/r/trolleyproblem/comments/1g5k4qh/comment/lsc8d7n/?context=3</p>
    <p>A 'spirit' (a being with consciousness, intelligence, but no worldly experience) made to experience 7 days in most people's shoes, would loathe it. Life may feel enjoyable due to our experiences in childhood, but adult life for many is mostly work. A spirit with no preconception that life is meaningful will not glean that ideology from experiencing adult life.</p>
    <p>For many non-existence remains more desirable to existence.</p>

    <p><strong>My antinatalist argument in feminism:</strong> We ought to make the world a better place for everyone, because it is unethical to bring anyone into a world where the positives do not make up for the negatives.</p>

    <p>I'm making <a href="https://github.com/BlueBunnex/MichelleTech">MichelleTech</a>, a shoddy mishmash of an attempt at learning modding.</p>

    <pre style="border: 1px solid lightgrey; padding: 1em;">
    Hemp (crop + item) (used for rope, chemicals, and THC extract)
    I think I also wanna add trams or some form of fast transport

    power/wiring system
    
    different kinds of reactors (Star Reactor, takes in star matter blocks, which
    are a type of block that when placed immediately explode violently)
    Arc Crucible (need power): input: ingots to change percentage and output amount
    50% copper 50% tin => 5x bronze ingot
    80% tin 20% gold => 10x useless slag ingot
    
    centrifuge: hemp + water bottle = THC extract
    centrifuge: THC extract + pork = weed gummy
    </pre>

    <h2>Forever Indev (indev fork)</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/BlueBunnex/Forever-Indev">the repo for Findev</a>

    Basically being spearheaded entirely by steven2024 (the best)

    <p>this version uses babric. I think modding for this would be cool just for how simple of a foundation it is, but honestly I feel like the charm could fade quickly without the substance of later versions</p>

    <h2>1.7.10</h2>
    <p><strong>Minecraft has been ruined with corporate bloat. <i>I</i> intend to save it.</strong></p>

    <p>Once I find out how, I will mod for <strong>1.7.10</strong>, the best version of Minecraft (nostalgic, mostly good non-bloat features, and popular for modding).</p>

    <p>
        [<a href="https://github.com/makamys/forge-mod-template">Forge mod template?</a>]
        [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJc-F1FMlyA">Forge setup tutorial video?</a>]
    </p>
    
    <p>I think making friends over modding would be fun, since I like participating in the community. Each mod will probably have their own Github, given it's a big enough project to need that kind of version control.</p>

    <p>I'm gonna make the Mo' Picks mod and add. dirt pickaxe</p>
