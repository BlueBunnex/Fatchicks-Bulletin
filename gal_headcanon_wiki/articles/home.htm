<p><strong>Gal Wiki</strong> hosts information about my headcanon of the characters from <i>My Girlfriend Is A Gal</i> following the main arc of the anime (I never read the manga).</p>

<p>I referenced both <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34403/Hajimete_no_Gal">My Anime List</a> and <a href="https://hajimete-no-gal.fandom.com/wiki/Hajimete_No_gal_Wiki">Fandom</a> for information regarding the anime (of course, deviating where my headcanon specifies).</p>

<p>Basically after the main arc Junichi joins the military, Yukana gains weight, and then the girls make a baking club and call the baking club Junichi's Confectionery Club. They send him pictures of what they baked while he's on service (and also of them eating it). Yukana's feelings for Junichi become even warmer and more motherly from their time apart.</p>
