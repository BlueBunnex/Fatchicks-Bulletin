<h1>Junichi's Confectionery Club</h1>

<p><strong>Junichi's Confectionery Club</strong> is a baking club that was established following the girls starting college and the boys' deployment into the military, and which continued following graduation as a mutual hobby amongst the girls. It is named after <a>Junichi</a> as a token of <a href="yukana_yame">Yukana's</a> love for him.</p>

<p>Club activities revolve around baking new treats every week and sending photos to Junichi. These photos include them during baking, the final product, and them eating the treats they made.</p>
