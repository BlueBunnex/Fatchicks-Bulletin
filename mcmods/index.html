    <h1>A page for all my mods</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>All my mods are small and self-contained (perfect for modpacks!).</li>
        <li>All my mods require Fabric.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I don't have any mods bc I don't know how to mod sob. I should learn how to use Fabric (or Babric for beta). I think making friends over modding would be fun :3</p>
    <p>Each mod would probably have their own github, but a separate download right on the website? idk logistics is hard</p>
