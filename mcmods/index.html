    <h1>A page for all my mods</h1>

    <p>I have interest in modding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modern</strong> because big community and extensive documentation [<a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:start">Fabric tutorial</a>]</li>
        <li><strong>1.5.2</strong> because of my love of Hexxit [<a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/mapping-and-modding-tutorials/1571481-1-5-2-1-5-1-1-4-7-1-3-2-creating-mods-modloader#c2">Forge tutorial</a>]</li>
        <li><strong>b1.7.3</strong> because smol baby Minecraft [<a href="https://babric.github.io/">Babric</a>]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>My mods that I make in the future, and am proud of, will all be available here! While I might make this page dedicated, for now it's an extension of my blog.</p>
    
    <!--
        I think making friends over modding would be fun, since I like participating in the community :3
        "pre-1.12 versions are usually forge's domain; there are some very popular modding scenes for older versions of minecraft" (I should find out what those scenes are lol)
        Each mod should probably have their own Github... or just float around on my computer? idk logistics is hard

    -->

    <ul style="background: #222; padding: 1em 2em; border-left: 4px solid #d40;">
        <li>All my mods are small and self-contained (perfect for modpacks!).</li>
        <li>All my mods require a Forge launcher.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Below are some mods I want to make:</p>
    
    <table>

        <tr>
            <td>
                <h3>Milfium (1.16.5)</h3>
                <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MwosSvlqL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg">
                <p>More of a test mod than anything else. Adds a new ore, with its own tools and armorset! Equal to diamond, but more durable than netherite!</p>
                <p>Made for 1.16.5 because it's right before caves and cliffs, and that version just seems popular for modding.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft">Download on Curseforge</a></p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        
        <tr>
            <td>
                <h3>Son of a Fish!</h3>
                <img src="https://minecraft.wiki/images/Raw_Cod_JE3.png?f6757">
                <p>Simply expands the variety of fish that can be caught from fishing. Inspired by <a href="https://x.com/tellioaridoitsu/status/1828290518595641788">this tweet</a>.</p>
                <p>Most fish (exceptions include crab, shrimp, etc) cook into the same item (cooked fish fillet), but bigger fish cook into more of them.</p>

                <p>Don't like sifting through lots of chests? Simplify storage with the cyberchest! This midgame block is crafted with eight iron surrounding one diamond. It functions like a chest, but with an infinite scrollable inventory and search bar.</p>
