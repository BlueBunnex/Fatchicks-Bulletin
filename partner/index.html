    <h1>I'm a social failure</h1>
    <p>I'm here to answer the questions: What do I want, what can I expect to get, what do I have to give?</p>
    <p>I need to study what I can reasonably expect from a partner, and what is unrealistic. I should also understand that the relationship is reciprocal, that what I ask for I should be willing to in turn provide.</p>
    <p>I think having my feelings understood would be nice. Maybe understanding someone else's would be too? I am unsure.</p>
