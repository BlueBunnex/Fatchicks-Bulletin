    <p>I like worldbuilding + character design, but since the latter is hard I'll just steal good characters and put them into my own world</p>
    <p>maybe I should write short story... 3 paragraph story... yees</p>
    <p>btw canonically all the "good guys" women have gigantic breasts and all the "bad guys" women are flat, also the setting is like victorian fantasy</p>
