    <p>I like worldbuilding + character design, but since the latter is hard I'll just steal good characters and put them into my own world</p>
    <p>maybe I should write short story... 3 paragraph story... yees</p>
    <p>Setting: victorian fantasy, canonically all the "good guys" women have gigantic breasts and all the "bad guys" women are flat</p>

    <h2>Conflicts</h2>
    
    <h3>Natural lactite is dwindling</h3>
    <p><strong>Lactite</strong> is a magical mineral - added to meals like salt - that firms and develops the features. It naturally formed deep in the mountains of minland thousands of years ago, but in recent times it has become clear that supplies won't last forever. As unease sweeps the continent, royal mages - apprentices of good and evil alike - attempt to find a spell to synthesize the stuff.</p>
