    <p>This is a <strong>small</strong> world building project. I really like worldbuilding but get bored quickly, but no harm in trying.</p>
    <p>Setting: victorian fantasy, canonically all the "good guys" women have gigantic breasts and all the "bad guys" women are flat</p>

    <i>
        <p>I like worldbuilding + character design, but since the latter is hard I'll just steal good characters and put them into my own world</p>
        <p>maybe I should write short story... 3 paragraph story... yees</p>

    <h2>General world information</h2>
    
    <h3>Lactite</h3>
    <p><strong>Lactite</strong> is a magical mineral — added to meals like salt — that firms and develops the features. It naturally formed deep in the mountains of Minland thousands of years ago, but in recent times it has become clear that supplies won't last forever. As unease sweeps the continent, and royal mages — apprentices of good and evil alike — attempt to find a spell that can reverse the depletion.</p>
    
    <h3>Calendar</h3>
    <p>Calendar years are recorded as the number of years since lactite was first discovered and mined, the flagstone event leading up to the founding of Minland.</p>
    <p>The present year is 642, a whole one-hundred years after the end of Princess Minette IX's rein.</p>
    
    <h2>Characters</h2>

    <h3>Valentine (500-562)</h3>
    <img src="valentine.webp">
    <p>A sweet farmer girl whose home town was ransacked, and who in the chaos was captured by Deoslandians, tossed into a dungeon for what Deosland royalty intended to be... forever.</p>

    <h3>Princess Minette IX (476-542)</h3>
    <img src="princess_minette.webp">
    <p>The crown princess and heir to the thrown of Minland. Behind closed doors, her servants characterize her as lazy, unprepared, and a threat to the crown — but she possesses more power than they think.</p>

    <h3>Giselle (?-Present)</h3>
    <img src="giselle.png">
    <p>A mage with an unknown, grey past, she deeply desires to be the one to discover the secrets of lactice formation. Her whereabouts at any given time are unknown to anyone, only known that she always seems to be right in the place she wants to be.</p>

    <h2>Map</h2>

    <h3>Minland</h3>
    <p>The royal land, and the smallest country on the map. The royal family's castle peers over the continent from atop a mountain of gold and lactite. Unlike Boland and Deosland — which have existed since ages long since forgotten — Minland only spread its roots in the then-uninhabited Minish Mountains 642 years ago, its extensive history kept dutifully documented and up to date.</p>
    
    <h3>Boland</h3>
    <p>A northern, flat and rural land, with a few large cities and many more small farming towns. Bolandian cowgirls are some of the bustiest in all the land.</p>
    
    <h3>Deosland</h3>
    <p>The evil mountainous land... flat women live here...</p>
