    <p>I like worldbuilding + character design, but since the latter is hard I'll just steal good characters and put them into my own world</p>
    <p>maybe I should write short story... 3 paragraph story... yees</p>
    <p>Setting: victorian fantasy, canonically all the "good guys" women have gigantic breasts and all the "bad guys" women are flat</p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>

    <h3>Valentine</h3>

    <h3>Minland</h3>
    <p>The royal land, and the smallest country on the map. The royal family's castle peers over the continent from atop a mountain of gold.</p>

    <p>A northern, flat and rural land, with a few large cities and many more small farming towns.</p>
