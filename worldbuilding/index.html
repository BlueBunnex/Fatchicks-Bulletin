    <p>I like worldbuilding + character design, but since the latter is hard I'll just steal good characters and put them into my own world</p>
    <p>maybe I should write short story... 3 paragraph story... yees</p>
    <p>btw canonically all the "good guys" women have gigantic breasts and all the "bad guys" women are flat, also the setting is like victorian fantasy</p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>

    <h3>Valentine</h3>
    <img src="valentine.webp">
    <p>Farmer girl.</p>

    <h2>Language</h2>

    <h3>Common</h3>
    <p>Seven vowel system (like Italian).</p>

    <h2>Map</h2>
    
    <h3>Éndredél</h3>
    <p>Translates to "northern land." Very flat and rural, with two large cities (Azder and Tét) and many more small farming towns.</p>
    
    <h3>Goldél</h3>
    <p>Translates to "evil land" (exonym). Flat women live here...</p>
