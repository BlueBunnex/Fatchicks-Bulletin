        <p>As a paraphilia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_fetishism">breast fetishism</a> is a sexual interest that focuses exclusively on the female breasts, and is a type of partialism.[2] The term breast fetishism is also used in the non-paraphilic sense, to refer to cultural attention to female breasts and the sexuality they represent.</p>
        <p>Scientists hypothesize that non-paraphilic sexual attraction to breasts is the result of their function as a secondary sex characteristic. The breasts play roles in both sexual pleasure and reproduction.</p>
