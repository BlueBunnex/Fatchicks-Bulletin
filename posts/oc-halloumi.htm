<h1>Halloumi</h1>

<p><strong>Halloumi</strong> is a shortstack alien made entirely of goo, which she refers to it as her "girl honey." She crash landed onto Earth 25 years ago, and has since made herself comfortable with the natives and the delicious food they make.</p>
<p>Food she ingests is quickly converted to goo in her body, making her lardier. This goo can be safely harvested, and tastes lightly of vanilla. While she has the ability to change where goo is distributed across her body, she cannot make herself taller, and so exceeding a certain volume she becomes wider than tall.</p>
