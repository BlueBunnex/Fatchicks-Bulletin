<h1>Halloumi</h1>

<p>A gooey shortstack alien. She crash landed onto Earth 25 years ago, and has since made herself comfortable with the natives and the delicious food they make.</p>
<p>Food she ingests is quickly converted to goo in her body, making her lardier. This cannot make her taller, and so she is often wider than she is tall. She has the ability to change where goo is distributed across her body, transferring it to her tail when not needed elsewhere. As a result, her tail is often too fat for her to lift.</p>
<p>The goo her body is made from can be safely harvested, and tastes lightly of vanilla. She refers to it as her "girl honey."</p>
