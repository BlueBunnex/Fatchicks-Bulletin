    <h1>Tamara</h1>
    <p>Tamara is a plump, feminine foxgirl who lives in the city. Her occupation as a senior management director at <strong>Holstein Hills Trading Co.</strong> puts her in close proximity with other women around her size. But despite her similar curvature and pretty face, she outright rejects the idea that she herself is attractive.</p>
