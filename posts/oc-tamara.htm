<p>Tamara is a plump, feminine foxgirl who lives in the city. Her occupation as a senior management director at <strong>Holstein Hills Trading Co.</strong> puts her in close proximity with other women around her size. But despite her similar curvature and pretty face, she outright rejects the idea that she herself is attractive, instead electing to focus on her work keeping everything in order and the people happy.</p>
