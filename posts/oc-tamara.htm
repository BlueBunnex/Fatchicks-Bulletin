<p><strong>Tamara</strong> is a plump, feminine foxgirl who lives in the city. She's an accomplished, caring woman, proud to call herself senior milking director at <i>Holstein Hills Trading Co.</i>. This position puts her in close proximity with other women around her size, but despite her similar curvature and pretty face, she outright rejects the idea that she herself is attractive — this is to say, she's quite prude.</p>
<!-- personality: large and in charge, confident, pompous?; caring, nurturing, motherly -->
