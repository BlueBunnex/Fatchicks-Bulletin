<h1>A mini course on productivity</h1>

<p>Having work due is stressful, and naturally you want to put it off - this happened for me in college. [...]</p>

<p>Some reasons you might avoid being productive are:</p>
<h2>The work is boring</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Set a goal</strong>. (what to finish/feel accomplished about, group stuff together)</li>
    <li><strong>Set a reward</strong>. (Finishing your work is often not a strong enough reward, especially when it's only one of many. jacking off)</li>
    <li><strong>Set a timeframe</strong>. How long do you think this work will take? (even if you don't finish in that time, it lets you pace yourself, and makes you more conscious about how much time you're spending working, which makes you feel more productive)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The work is important, and you don't want to mess it up</h2>
<ul>
    <li>change your mindset from "perfect" to "get it over with," change your problem from "scared" to "bored"</li>
</ul>

<h2>You keep getting distracted</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>If you're being distracted by another assignment</strong>, flipping between the two slows your work down a lot. Close the one that's due later. Getting one of them finished will make it easier to work on the other one, which means working on one is basically working on both.</li>
    <li><strong>If you're being distracted by fun</strong>, recognize what is most important to do now. Getting the work done will mean slacking off feels earned.</li>
</ul>
