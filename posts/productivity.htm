<h1>A mini course on productivity</h1>

<p>Having work due is stressful, and naturally you want to put it off - this happened for me in college. I know I want to get the work done, and so I have come up with ways to trick myself into working.</p>
<p>Some reasons you might avoid being productive are:</p>

<h2>The work is boring</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Set a goal</strong>. A goal can be a single task or a group of tasks that you want done before you finish working. At the end of the day, think about what goals you set and accomplished â€” knowing how much you accomplished is motivating.</li>
    <li><strong>Set a timeframe</strong>. How long do you think this work will take? Choose a clock time and start working, but don't finish when that time is reached. The time is there to let you pace yourself, and makes you more conscious about how much time you're spending working, which makes you feel more productive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The work is important, and you don't want to mess it up</h2>
<p>If you're worrying about being perfect, being perfect sucks. Wanting everything to be perfect means you'll be scared of all work, which means you'll be scared all the time. That's bad. Try working hard enough to be good (slightly better than 'just getting by') and only be perfect when you have the motivation. Even then, only be as perfect as you enjoy, then switch back to good.</p>

<h2>You keep getting distracted</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>If you're being distracted by another assignment</strong>, flipping between the two slows your work down a lot. Close the one that's due later. Getting one of them finished will make it easier to work on the other one, which means working on one is basically working on both.</li>
    <li><strong>If you're being distracted by fun</strong>, recognize what is most important to do now. Getting the work done will mean slacking off feels earned.</li>
    <li><strong>Set a reward</strong>. When you have a lot of work, finishing only one part might not feel like a strong enough reward, even though it is progressing you to being finished. A reward can be anything you want to do after working, such as a shower, eating dinner, or masturbating. Whenever you feel distracted, remember that finishing your work sooner means you can enjoy your reward sooner.</li>
</ul>

<h2>I just feel burnt out</h2>
<p><strong>DON'T MAKE ANY IMPORTANT DECISIONS RIGHT NOW!</strong> If you're burnt out, you want to stop being burnt out. But this can mean doing things that are bad, like deleting a project so you don't have to worry about finishing it. Working while burnt out can make you more burnt out, but to avoid that:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Do the easy part of a task.</strong> If you are stressing about writing a whole essay, first just write your main thesis. This is a lot easier than thinking about doing the whole essay, but is still productive because future you will already start with a thesis in mind. This same idea can be applied to more than just an essay, as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Change your workspace.</strong> Staying in the same place makes you feel stuck. Moving to a different place can be refreshing.</li>
    <li><strong>Just stop.</strong> Stop trying to force yourself to work. Stop trying to force yourself to feel better. Wait until you feel better, then continue your work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Even after I've finished, I still feel stressed</h2>
<p>Maybe it's because you are worried you didn't do well enough, or because [...]</p>
