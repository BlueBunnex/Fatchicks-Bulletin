    <h1>Medicine ball is love. Medicine ball is life.</h1>
    <p>I am getting back into fitness. At my gym we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_ball">medicine balls</a> that I can use to exercises like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pickups</strong> (starting in a squat with the ball on the ground in front of you, then standing straight while lifting the ball above your head)</li>
        <li><strong>Around the Worlds</strong> (holding the ball above your head, then <i>slowly and controlledly</i> swinging it to the side and behind your head)</li>
        <li><strong>Up and Outs</strong> (holding the ball straight up, bringing it to your chest, then pushing it straight out)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Medicine balls are good for training strength and coordination.</p>
