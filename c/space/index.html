    <h2>Selorians</h2>
    <p>Selorians are a developed reptilian alien species. They are classified as <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.9em;">COOPERATIVE</span> by the United Stellar Family (USF). Of biological interest are their extremely large, breast-like organs that inflate with air as a preemptive, unconscious response to an anticipated reduction in air quality or availability. Most Selorian life support units do not include an oxygen recycler as a result.</p>
