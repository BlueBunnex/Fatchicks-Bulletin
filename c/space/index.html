    <h2>Selorians</h2>
    <p>Selorians are a developed reptilian alien species. They are classified as <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.9em;">COOPERATIVE</span> by the United Stellar Family (USF). Of biological interest are their extremely large, breast-like organs that inflate with air as a preemptive, unconscious response to an anticipated reduction in air quality or availability. In consequence, most Selorian life support units do not include an oxygen recycler.</p>

What grade did you get on pressure assessment?" She flips through your file. "A+, weird." She does not elaborate.</p>
    <p>"Say, I heard most human males like boobs. Well, Selorians got boobs."</p>
    <p>"What, bigger than you're used to? You'll have this view whenever you want, 'long as you promise to never go back to human women ever again."</p>
