    <p>Yandere is a term used to describe a character who is extremely possessive and violent towards their love interest. While often initially sweet and innocent, their love can make them sick and lead to extreme, violent, or psychotic behavior.</p>
    <p>"if you leave me, I'll kill you" ok, I won't do that then, can you pamper me now</p>
    <p>"Come on, why won't you just go out with me?! I love you and have an amazing body (if you ignore my belly)!"</p>
