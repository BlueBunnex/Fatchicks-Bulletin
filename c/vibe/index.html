    <p>my conworld, a multi-trillion dollar company's virtual sandbox that's very exclusive! if you can manage to get your hands on a <strong>consumer key</strong> from their annual drops, or get a job there for a temporary <strong>employee key</strong>, you can jack your VR headset into their server and discover ANOTHER WORLD...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>most of the company's job positions are carried out from within the sandbox - moderators, technicians, artists, you name it</li>
        <li>every player gets a mommy-coded AI companion who acts as your personal cheerleader, chef, and life coach - not to mention, she has GIGANTIC breasts! customize her to your heart's content!</li>
        <li><strong>public zones</strong> are where you'll spend the bulk of your time, but they give each player their own <strong>private zone</strong> too! server space is kinda limited though, so it has an 8GB upload limit for 3D objects and stuff</li>
    </ul>
