    <p><strong>Bastite</strong>, a blue metal that is dropped by those pesky goblins in the mountains. It isn't magical, nor is it particularly tough, but it's lightweight and it's abundant, which is good enough for most adventurers' gear.</p>
    <p><strong>Bastite-tin alloy</strong> is used for roofing, superior to tin alone by being ever-so-slightly cheaper.</p>
    <p><strong>Bastite-iron alloy</strong>, with its improved malleability and higher weight, makes it perfect for swords that need to be beaten to a razor's edge.</p>

    <p><strong>Rudite</strong>, a semi-rare magical metal whose wearer during exertion burns magical energy instead of calories from fat. The wearer still gets hungry, however, because while their fat is not depleting, their stomach will continue to desire food when empty.</p>

    <p><strong>???</strong>, a rare, luxury magical metal that, when heated above 40Â°C, flips its own gravity. Its gold alloy brings the flip point down to body temperature, which is useful for especially fat ladies, though only the most affluent can afford it for themselves and their most noble knights.</p>
