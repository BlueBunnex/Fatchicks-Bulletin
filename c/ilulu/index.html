I wish I had a character to obsess over like you
well just think of a character that you would 100% marry irl
like not just a qucik
cum n go
like you genuinely would want to fug everyday
and then take care

ilulu is snarky
would you unironically draw ilulu everyday? or atelast every week
I do like her design a lot, and I wrote fanfiction about her one time
she is cute and booba and very appealing design
