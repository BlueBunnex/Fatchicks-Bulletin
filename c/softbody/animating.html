        <h1>Softbody BBW Simulation in Blender</h1>

        <h2>Animating</h2>
        <p>If you're just satisfied with simulating BBWs flopping onto the floor, you can skip to the next section on <strong>Exporting a video.</strong> If you're interested in growth sequences, animating movement, and so forth, keep reading!</p>

        <h3>Making some parts of the model fixed in place (Cloth pinning)</h3>
        <p><strong>If you want some vertices to be fixed in place, you can pin them.</strong> They will stay locked in place while the non-pinned parts will behave like a soft-body.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select your object.</li>
            <li>Create a new vertex group under <var>Data > Vertex Groups</var> and clicking the + symbol. Rename it to "Pin", or anything else you'd like.</li>
            <li>Go into edit mode (by pressing tab), select the vertices you want to be pinned, and assign them to the vertex group you made by clicking <var>Assign</var> while the vertices are selected.</li>
            <li>Go to <var>Physics > Shape</var> (under cloth properties) and assign your new vertex group to <var>Pin Group</var>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>If you want to move/animate the pinned vertices,</strong> you can attach them to a <strong>hook</strong>.</p>

        <p>Moving/animating the hook will move the pinned vertices.</p>
